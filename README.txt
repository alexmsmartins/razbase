What's this?
------------
Some interesting concepts and related utilities.

Why?
----
Well, just like i wish I didn't have to write it, there's no point in making others write it, 
should they need it. It's not like it's anything smart so far and possibly not useful, but 
maybe others find it useful. The more the better.


Details
-------
The code is generally self-documented. Keep your eyes out for package.html and similar stuff.


Roadmap
-------
I will only maintain this as I need to. If there's some large user community developing (doubt that, really), 
we'll see - I could co-op some volunteers.

I will add more code as I need it/write it for all kinds of reasons.
