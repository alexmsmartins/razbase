What's this?
------------
Some interesting concepts and related utilities.

Why?
----
Well, just like i wish I didn't have to write it, there's no point in making others write it, should they need it. 


Details
-------
The code is generally self-documented. Keep your eyes out for package.html and similar stuff.


Roadmap
-------
I will only maintain this as I need to. If there's some large user community developing (doubt that, really), 
we'll see - I could co-op some volunteers.

I will add more code as I need it/write it for all kinds of reasons.
